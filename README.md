# WHAT-S-IN-AN-AVOCADO-TOAST-A-SUPPLY-CHAIN-ANALYSIS-USING-PYTHON
Just wrapped up a really fun and surprisingly complex project: a supply chain analysis of the ingredients in avocado toast — yes, the avocado toast 🥑🍞

Using the Open Food Facts database, I analyzed the origins of avocados, lemons, sourdough-related grains, and olive-oil ingredients to understand how global supply chains come together to create a single brunch favorite.

This project involved filtering messy food-category data, joining CSV/TXT files, cleaning multi-tag fields, and extracting country-of-origin information to map where our everyday ingredients really come from.

Amazing how one simple plate can rely on supply chains spanning multiple continents.

In this project, I conducted a supply chain analysis of three core ingredients used in avocado toast using Open Food Facts data. I filtered noisy category tags, joined ingredient files with their relevant category lists, extracted country-of-origin information, and built cleaned datasets showing where each ingredient is produced.

The work highlights how global, diverse, and interconnected the supply chain is for even the simplest modern dishes — and sets the foundation for further analysis on transportation distances and time-at-sea.
